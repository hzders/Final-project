Description: This package includes three functions to calculate
  the chemoindex (CI) of nematodes to chemicals. Using a dataframe, 
  the functions can perform the calculation for CI, calculate the mean and 
  standard deviation and standard error of CI. Furthermore, it can make a 
  barchart based on the mean and add standard deviation or standard error 
  to the bar.
